## Tips for Beginners

- **HTML Basics**: Familiarize yourself with HTML tags and structure. Use comments to organize your code.
- **CSS Basics**: Learn about selectors, properties, and values. Use classes and IDs to apply styles to specific elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Use relative units (like percentages) and media queries to make your website look good on all devices.
